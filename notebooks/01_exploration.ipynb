# --- 1. Data Loading ---
# Assuming the Google Cluster Data is downloaded and placed in the 'data/' directory.
# You might need to adjust the file path and name based on the actual downloaded data.
try:
    file_path = '../data/cluster_data.csv' # Placeholder file name
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    print(f"Successfully loaded data from {file_path}")

    exit()
except Exception as e:

# --- 2. Data Exploration (Placeholder) ---
# Perform initial data exploration here.
# This might include:
# - Checking for missing values: df.isnull().sum()
# - Descriptive statistics: df.describe()
# - Visualizations: Histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrix
# - Identifying target variable and features

# Example: Assuming 'load_spike' is the target variable (0 for normal, 1 for spike)
# And other columns are features.
# You will need to define your features (X) and target (y) based on your dataset.
# For demonstration, let's assume some dummy features and a target.
# IMPORTANT: Replace these with actual column names from your dataset.
features = [col for col in df.columns if col not in ['timestamp', 'load_spike']] # Example feature selection
target = 'load_spike' # Example target variable

# Check if target and features exist in the dataframe
if target not in df.columns:
    print(f"Error: Target column '{target}' not found in the dataset. Please adjust 'target' variable.")
    exit()
for feature in features:
    if feature not in df.columns:
        print(f"Warning: Feature column '{feature}' not found in the dataset. Please adjust 'features' list.")
        # You might want to remove non-existent features or exit
        features.remove(feature)

if not features:
    print("Error: No valid features found after checking. Cannot proceed with model training.")
    exit()

X = df[features]
y = df[target]

# --- 3. Data Preprocessing and Standardization ---
# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Initialize StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit on training data and transform both training and testing data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

print("\nData standardized using StandardScaler.")
print(f"Shape of X_train_scaled: {X_train_scaled.shape}")
print(f"Shape of X_test_scaled: {X_test_scaled.shape}")

# --- 4. Model Implementation (RandomForestClassifier) ---
print("\nInitializing RandomForestClassifier...")
# You can tune hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, etc.
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
print("RandomForestClassifier trained successfully.")

# --- 5. Model Evaluation ---
print("\nEvaluating the model...")
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)

# Optional: Visualize Confusion Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', cbar=False,
            xticklabels=['Predicted 0', 'Predicted 1'],
            yticklabels=['Actual 0', 'Actual 1'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()

# --- Further Steps ---
# - Hyperparameter tuning for RandomForestClassifier (e.g., using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)
# - Feature importance analysis: model.feature_importances_
# - Cross-validation
# - Experiment with other tree-based models (e.g., GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBoost, LightGBM)
# - Deploy the trained model (e.g., save using joblib or pickle)
